# Replace Commas with New Lines

This Python script reads a text file, replaces commas with new lines, and saves the modified content to another file.

## Description

Have you ever had a text file with comma-separated values and wished to transform it into a more readable format with each value on a new line? 
This simple Python script does just that! It takes an input file containing comma-separated strings and converts them into a more user-friendly format with one string per line.
